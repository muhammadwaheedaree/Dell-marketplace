# Dell Marketplace 🎉  

Welcome to **Dell Marketplace**, a fun beginner project I created while diving into Next.js. It's my way of practicing and testing my skills—so think of it as a baby step into the big world of web development. 😎  

## 🚀 Live Demo

## 🛠️ Built With  
- **Next.js**: My new coding BFF.  
- **Tailwind CSS**: Making things look fancy without losing my sanity.  
- **TypeScript**: Because bugs are scary, and I like a bit of structure.  

## 🧐 What’s the Vibe?  
- It’s responsive! (Works great on all devices, including your grandma’s phone.)  
- Simple and clean design—because I’m still mastering the art of adding *just enough*.  
- Built as a practice project, so don’t expect Tesla-level sophistication… yet. 🚀
